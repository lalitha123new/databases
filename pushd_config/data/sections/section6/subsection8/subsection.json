				"<strong>Some simple ways by which you can learn to be mindful in your everyday activities are mentioned below.</strong>"
				"Some of these activities are the ones we pay very little attention to or we tend to complete them rather hurriedly and mechanically / in what is known as an \"autopilot mode\".",
				"Examples for practicing mindfulness: Choosing to eat a meal mindfully and observing the texture of the food, savoring the taste in the mouth and chewing slowly; walking mindfully by observing the steps taken, the pressure of each foot on the floor and by feeling the movement as one walks; watching the time go by: watching the clock for a whole minute as the second's hands moves gradually and just observing it as it reaches the full minute. Similarly bathing mindfully, observing nature and so on can also be practiced.",
