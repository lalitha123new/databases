"Here is an example of a short letter that Neena wrote to herself, using a compassionate friend's perspective<br>",
				"<strong>Dear Neena,</strong>",
				"<br>I know you have been going through a very tough time. You keep thinking as to what is wrong with you and why you can't cope with these things in your life when other people seem to be doing so much better at handling their own challenges in life.",
				"In reality, Neena, you being human - you have your limitations and weaknesses just as other human beings have their own. This does not make you a 'bad' person or an 'unlovable' person.",
				"I know that you are trying your best to correct things that went wrong and your genuine need to correct things is in itself worthy of appreciation, even if you are not very successful in correcting these things at this point-simply because some of this is not totally in your control .  ",
				"<br><strong>Your best friend</strong>"
