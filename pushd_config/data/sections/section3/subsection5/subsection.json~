					"Start with planning small changes that are specific and feasible.<br><br>",
					"Notice and appreciate small gains rather than waiting for the larger/ultimate outcome. It can act as an inherent motivator.<br><br>",
					"Reward yourself for efforts you put in towards implementing your plan:<br>The typical tendency of others around us as well as ourselves is that we link rewards to final outcomes (e.g. I would get a bike if I get at least seventy percent in the final exams). It is OK to celebrate when one achieves a desired outcome. But setting such conditions is not very useful for motivation because the outcomes may be far away in time and these depend on multiple factors outside a person's control (e.g. a very difficult question paper).<br>A more realistic way of setting up conditions for rewards is that we/others reward us for the specific amount of efforts we make for specific period (e.g. I would reward myself with a new set of clothes if I am regularly and sincerely putting in 5-6 hours of focused study per day as per the plan, for the next two months). <br>(We need to remember that over-using rewards can actually have negative consequences! Having a well-planned reward system does not mean that we need to reward ourselves for each and every task accomplished. The best approach is to use rewards as an aid to motivation only for tasks that are not inherently interesting to us or cannot be turned into an enjoyable one.)<br><br>",
					"Reward yourself in proportion to your efforts. <br>The size of the reward should match the difficulty of the task for a person and the amount of effort that is required by that person to do the task. <br>If I find it most difficult to do any kind of exercise, then I can begin with rewarding myself for doing a small amount of exercise daily and this should be linked with more reward points than other things that I do not find so difficult (e.g. studying for one hour every day which may not be so difficult for me). <br>Rewards are not always material things. Rewards could be some activities that we like to do or even a visual/graphic feedback (a progress chart) or time-off from something etc. It is good to continue to discover your unique rewards. Be creative and vary the kinds of rewards over time.<br><br>",
                    "Gradually increase the amount of efforts for which you decide to reward yourself. It is often a good strategy to start with rewarding oneself for smaller bits of efforts and then increase the efforts required for rewarding oneself.<br><br> ",
                    "Practice visual imagery that motivates you. Use cues that motivate you.<br><br>",
