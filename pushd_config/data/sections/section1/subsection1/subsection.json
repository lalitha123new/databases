						"explanation" : [
											{
												"id" : "1",
												"p" : "The words depression and sadness are sometimes used interchangeably in common speech. For instance, we might hear people say `I'm really depressed` when they mean to say `I'm very sad`."
											},
											{
												"id" : "2",
												"p" : "People tend to mistakenly associate the clinical condition of depression with the experience of sadness. We all experience sadness as a normal human emotion triggered by difficult, hurtful experiences or situations in life. Such sadness lifts when the situation changes or the emotional pain fades."
											},
											{
												"id" : "3",
												"p" : "Thus, to state broadly/simply,"
											},
											{
												"id" : "4",
												"p" : "1) Sadness is generally a passing emotion, while depression is likely to be continuous."
											},
											{
												"id" : "5",
												"p" : "2) Common sadness is usually about something, while sadness in depression colours everything, i.e.,It is pervasive."
											},
											{
												"id" : "6",
												"p" : "3) While sadness usually has a trigger, depression may or may not have an identifiable trigger and even when there is some cause, the triggering circumstance/s may not sufficiently account for the severity and intensity of depression."
											},	
											{
												"id" : "7",
												"p" : "4) Unlike normal sadness, depression is accompanied by other symptoms in varying severity such as decline in energy, loss of pleasure, and feelings of being worthless or guilty, etc."
											},	
											{
												"id" : "8",
												"p" : "On the whole, depression is diagnosed based on a cluster of symptoms, their duration and severity and not merely based on presence of sadness."

						"questionNo" : "2",
						"questionContent" : "People get depressed only because of their life situations or negative life events, so if someone has not experienced any negative life event recently, he/she cannot have depression.",
						"answer" : "disagree",
						"explanation" : [
											{
												"id" : "1",
												"p" : "Because we tend to associate normal sadness with depression, we might think that people get depressed only because of their life situations or negative life events. However, clinical depression need not necessarily have a triggering event/situation."

						"explanation" : [
											{
												"id" : "1",
												"p" : "While in some cases depression may not have any identifiable triggering circumstance, in other cases the depressed person as well as others are aware of a major problem in life (e.g. failure in an important exam, death of a dear person, traumatic illness, etc) that has contributed to the depression."
											},
											{
												"id" : "2",
												"p"	: "While it is rather natural that a person may feel intense sadness in such circumstances, it is important to seek appropriate professional help if the grief/sadness amounts to clinical depression."
											}
											{
												"id" : "3",
												"p" : "Of course, the distinction between 'normal' sadness and clinical depression may be blurred/tricky in the context of a traumatic circumstance, especially during the initial days after a painful event. It is nevertheless important to mobilize necessary support in either case, i.e., whether or not the distress amounts to depression."

											{
												"id" : "4",
												"p" : "Depression may worsen the negative impact on health caused by the stressful situation and it may lower the person's ability to deal with the difficult situation."
											},
											{
												"id" : "5",
												"p" : "Hence depression has to be seen as an issue that needs to be addressed alongside the stressful/traumatic situation."

												"p" : "Mental conditions such as depression can happen to anyone irrespective of age, gender, education, and occupation."

						"explanation" : [
											{
												"id" : "1",
												"p" : "Depression does not present itself in the same way in all people. In some persons with depression, low mood is the prominent way it shows up, while in others, we may find irritability (more than usual) co-occurring with feeling low."

											{
												"id" : "1",
												"p" : "It is very much possible that individuals suffering from depression, especially mild levels of depression are able to carry on with their duties, although they may be finding it tiring/strenuous. The level of disturbance in one's day to day functioning increases with severity of depression."

												"p" : "Depression can occur to anyone irrespective of one's gender, age, education and cultural background. It can happen to men, women, children, teens, and the elderly."
											},
											{
												"id" : "2",
												"p"	: "It has been observed that a higher proportion of women are diagnosed with depression as compared to men. This difference has been linked to multiple bio-psycho-social reasons. However, it would be completely wrong to say that being male insulates one from having depression."

												"id" : "2",
												"p" : "Depression is a mental health condition that diminishes a person's energy and motivation for action. It may trigger the feelings of helplessness and pessimism."
											},
											{
												"id" : "3",
												"p" : "The decrease in the level of activity that accompanies should not be seen as laziness as though the person has chosen to be inactive. People do not choose to be depressed. It is a real mental health problem."

												"id" : "3",
												"p" : "When rightly prescribed and used regularly as prescribed, these medications can help in restoring one's normal mood. Depression, like many other mental health conditions involves chemical changes in the brain associated with the changes in mood."

												"id" : "4",
												"p" : "The anti-depressant medications can help in restoring the chemical balance and improve & stabilize the mood. Antidepressant medications are not addictive."

						"explanation" : [
											{
												"id" : "1",
												"p" : "Discussing about one's depression and the underlying reasons may be in itself distressing or uncomfortable for some people. However, staying alone and brooding over the painful experience could be much more problematic."

												"id" : "2",
												"p" : "If the person has been trying to keep the mind away from thinking of any traumatic experience that triggered depression, talking about that experience may lead to a temporary increase in distress.
