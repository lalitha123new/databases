					"If my best friend or someone who loves me knew I was thinking this, what would they say to me? What evidence would they point out to me that would suggest that my thoughts were not 100% true?",
					"When I have felt this way in the past, what did I think about that helped me feel better?",
					"What have I learned from prior experiences that could help me now?",
					"Five years from now, if I look back at this situation, will I look at it any differently?",
					"When I am not feeling this way, do I think about this type of situation any differently? ",
					"Are there any strengths or positives in me or the situation that I am ignoring?",
					"Am I jumping to any conclusions when I do not really have much evidence?",
					"Am I blaming myself for something over which I do not have complete control?",
					"What is the effect of thinking this way?",
					"What is an alternative way of looking at this situation and what would the effect of that be?",
					"What are the advantages and disadvantages of thinking this way?",
					"What is the worst that can happen and how can I deal with that?",

					"Am I responding and concluding based only on how I am feeling?",
					"Tip: Questioning your depressive/negative thoughts using one or more of the above questions may help in   reducing the intensity of your emotions and help you to take more rational and effective decisions than when you are emotionally upset or disturbed due to these thoughts."
