				"<strong>What are the common thinking errors (cognitive distortions)?</strong>",
				"<strong>Cognitive distortions are systematic errors</strong> in thinking or biases when interpreting situations, events and/or experiences.",
				"As a result of these \"thinking errors\" we make conclusions, or respond through our behaviors and emotions in unhelpful ways. As the name suggests they are biases, errors or distortions and therefore not an accurate interpretation of the event or situation.",
				"Based on information gathered from people experiencing anxiety and depression, clinicians and researchers have identified common cognitive distortions that people make while responding to situations and events.",

				"<strong>LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF ERRORS IN THINKING (COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS)</strong>",
				"<strong><font style='color: blue'>1. All or none thinking: </font></strong>",
				"All or none thinking is the tendency to evaluate situations, events, experiences in extreme categories.  It is also known as black or white thinking, polarized thinking, absolutistic thinking or perfectionistic thinking.",
				"A person using this distortion sees things in either extreme points (such as good or bad). Thus one may see oneself as a complete failure even when there is a small error or lapse. Excessive fear of making mistakes or being imperfect, avoiding making decisions and excessive self-criticality are some of the consequences of all or none thinking.",
				"Example: A student who believed that one is a successful student only when one gets 99% secured 95% and became very dejected viewing himself as a total failure. This way of evaluating things is unrealistic because situations and events are rarely one way or other or in black or white.",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>2. Over-generalization:</font></strong>",
				"A person is said to be using the error of overgeneralization when he/she bases the outcomes of all future events (e.g. exams, interviews, relationships) on a single negative event.",
				"Example: A person who does poorly at a job interview concludes, \" I will never get a job, there is no point in attending any more interviews\", resulting in his not going for any further interviews.",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>3. Selective Abstraction</font></strong>",
				"It is a tendency to selectively pick out a negative detail from a situation, while filtering out the positive aspects and conclude that the whole situation is negative.",
				"Example: A worker was given feedback that she is very punctual and efficient at the tasks she is assigned, but that she could work a little more on her communication.  The worker concludes, \"This means I am a bad worker; I can't do my job well!\"",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>4. Disqualifying the positive:</font></strong>",
				"It is a persistent tendency to transform or convert neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones, much like a \"reverse alchemy\" in which gold is turned into dirt! ",
				"Example: When someone sincerely appreciates the quality of work done and the person tells himself that \"they are just being nice\" the person is disqualifying the positive compliment received. ",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>5. Jumping to conclusion: </font></strong>",
				"It is the tendency to conclude or make decisions based on evidence that is not related to the event or with insufficient evidence.",
				"It can occur in two ways:",
				"<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'><li><strong>Mind reading:</strong> This occurs when the person jumps to the conclusion (without sufficient evidence or information) that others are negatively evaluating him/her. Here the person is making an assumption about the other person's thoughts/mental state (intentions).<br>Example:  A teacher fails to smile and return the greeting of a student while passing through a corridor. The student concludes that \"I must have done something to upset my teacher, he is angry with me\". This conclusion does not consider other possibilities or reasons such as \"the teacher was engrossed in a conversation with others and did not notice the greeting.\"</li><li><strong>Fortune telling:</strong> The fortune teller, also known as crystal ball gazing, involves making negative predictions based on little or unrelated evidence. This prediction is treated as an established fact resulting in negative emotions.<br>Example : A manager who had to present a new plan to his team members tells himself, \"it's all going to go bad, I am certain that it will be a poor show\".  This was a manager who was doing well and did not have any specific reason to make this prediction.</li></ol>",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>6. Magnification or Minimization:</font></strong>",
				"When using this style, the person exaggerates or magnifies the importance of certain outcomes or events or facts (one's own mistakes), while minimizing others things (positive contributions). Usually it is about magnifying one's own fault, while minimizing positive qualities.",
				"A person when asked about his week says feeling unhappy \"the whole week was a waste, it was so miserable\" and minimizes the events that went well or things that were accomplished.",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>7. Emotional reasoning:</font></strong>",
				"This involves an erroneous assumption that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \"I feel this way; therefore, it must be true\" or \"I feel guilty. Therefore, I must have done something bad\".  Thus a homemaker who feels sad says to herself,   \"I feel overwhelmed and hopeless.  It means my problems must be impossible to solve\".",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>8. Should Statements:</font></strong>",
				"Using imperative rules and statements involving 'should','should not' and 'must', often leads to an experience of guilt (when the person believes he/she has not been able to follow the rule) or frustration and anger when we impose such conditions/rules  on others who are expected to always follow the same without fail. ",
				"Example:  \"I must do that\" \"You must follow what I say at all costs and at all times\" \"I must always be on time\".\"Everybody must love me and reciprocate my affection for them\".",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>9. Labeling:</font></strong>",
				"Labeling is a kind of  thinking  error in which a single perceived characteristic of a person is thought to describe his/her whole qualities or attributes. Labels are usually emotion laden, negative and are based on attributes of a personor self (such as I am an idiot, I am useless, loser; she is a loser).  Labeling can result in feelings of inadequacy.",
				"Examples: Having failed to do a job on time for a parent, a lady tells herself: I am useless and irresponsible\"; having missed a target at work the employee concludes \"I am such an idiot- I bungled such a simple thing\".",
				"<br><strong><font style='color: blue'>10. Personalization: </font></strong>",
				"You may be committing this error when you see yourself almost entirely (blaming) as the cause of some negative event although in reality you were not primarily responsible for it.",
				"Example : A mother saw her child's report card with a note from the teacher which said that the child was not doing well in studies. She immediately concluded, \"I am a bad mother. It is entirely my fault that my daughter has done poorly.\""
