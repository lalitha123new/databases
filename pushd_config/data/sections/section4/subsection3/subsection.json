			"<strong>EXERCISES TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE COMMON THINKING ERRORS (COGNITIVE ERRORS)</strong>",
			"<strong>Situation: </strong>You are a homemaker. You serve your family a special dinner that you have cooked and after the dinner is over, your partner comments: 'The rice has come out very well although the vegetables in the side dish could have been cooked for a little while longer.'",
			"You think to yourself: 'I am a total failure.  I can't even make a simple dinner for my family.  I am a bad homemaker and there is no point in trying at all.' You feel very upset and sad.",
			"Your cognitive errors in this situation include one or more of the following:",
			"<font style='color: red'>a. All or none thinking</font>",
			"<font style='color: red'>b. Selective abstraction</font>",
			"c. Emotional Reasoning",
			"d. Catastrophization",
			"e. Fortune telling",
			"<div style='border:1px solid black; padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;background-color:#FFE0B2;'><strong>Explanation: </strong>This example shows that sometimes we may use more than one cognitive error at a time in a situation. When you tell yourself, 'I am a total failure,' you engage in all or none thinking. The vegetables were undercooked, but it does not necessarily mean YOU are a total failure. When you think, 'I can't even make a simple dinner for my family I am a bad homemaker'- based on the feedback from your husband, you have ignored the positive aspect of the feedback and you have focused only on the negative aspect (the rice was appreciated).<br> There is also an element of all or none thinking when you say 'there is no point in trying at all'. It is possible that such thoughts may lead to avoidance of future opportunities to cook special meals.</div>"
