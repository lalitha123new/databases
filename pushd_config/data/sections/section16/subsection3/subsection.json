Please see your response to the first set of items. Which of the four statements you marked? What does it tell you about your preoccupation with this goal? <br><strong> Action: </strong> To what extent you have started working on your growth goal? For how many of the 12 items have you marked agree or strongly agree?This would give you an idea about the extent to which you are taking actions to move towards your personal growth goals.<br>If you find yourself to be high on contemplation (thinking about it): Check out if you are also acting on it. It helps to think about the change we wish to make. But only 'thinking' about it repeatedly over a long period can be a frustrating experience! .<br>If you find yourself to be rather low on the action dimension, clarify within yourself: Is this the change that I really want to work upon as a goal? If yes, what can I do to start taking small steps that move me further in terms of acting on this goal? <br>Start enjoying and appreciating the efforts you are making towards growing as a person- because it is actually a continuous process rather than an end-point you have to reach."
