						"If you find that despite giving it a good try, you are not able to work at it and your mood is worsening, please remember that this self-care program may not be sufficient and that there are other modes of professional help (e.g. face-to-face psychotherapy and medication etc.) that can be of tremendous use. Connect to us and we would help you to get started on other forms of interventions which may be best suited for you at any given point of time."
