		"There are times when we get so preoccupied with some bothersome issues in our life that we fail to realize that this absorbs most of our time, effort and attention. Brooding over these not just takes away our energy but also adds to our sense of lack of control and mastery in life.",
		"On the other hand, introspection may help us realize that there are many aspects of our life which are partially under our control -- about which we can actually do something.",
		"The overall sense of mastery can be increased by becoming aware of such things/aspects of our life and redirecting adequate attention to them. Thus, by regaining some sense of mastery, we can experience an enhancement in our sense of wellbeing.",
		"<strong>TIP:</strong> Overall sense of mastery can be increased by paying attention to various aspects of the environment or life-situations which can be changed to some extent by making effective use of opportunities that may be potentially available, by engaging in activities that are in line with your values as well as have potentially useful long term impact"
