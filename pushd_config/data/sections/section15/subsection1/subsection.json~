                                " Thoughts about ending one's life can come to anyone. There are times in our lives, when we feel stuck, and there seems to be no possible solution which can take us out of our misery. During such moments, thoughts about death and dying may cross one’s mind. Thoughts about suicide can be scary. It is important to realize that getting suicidal thoughts is a sign that you are finding it difficult to cope with challenges in your life at this point of time and many of us go through such moments/periods in our lives.",

				" <strong>When do these thoughts occur? </strong><br><br>  Suicidal thoughts or death-wishes can occur when we feel that we don’t have enough coping resources to deal with the challenges we are experiencing. This may happen because of limitations in our resources (e.g. internal resources such as energy level or external resources such as supportive-figures) at any given point of time or the severity of the challenges /demands we are facing or a combination of both. Suicidal thinking can vary in severity. While death-wishes are passive thoughts where a person experiences transient wishes that life comes to an end (for e.g. death due to a fatal illness, accident, during sleep etc.); active suicidal thoughts are the thoughts which involve thinking about taking one’s life.

                                " <strong>  These thoughts may cross one’s mind because of various reasons such as:</strong><br><li> Feeling overwhelmed and unable to control situations in life (For e.g. frequent fights with friends or family)</li><li>  Feeling guilty (For e.g.  blaming oneself for  losing loved one)</li><li> Feeling stuck and powerless (For e.g. feeling trapped and not seeing a way out of a difficult situation, failing in an important exam)</li><li>  Feeling angry (For e.g. thinking of suicide as a way of taking  revenge)</li><li>  Feeling meaningless  (For e.g. an elderly person feeling empty and seeing no purpose to live on, feeling that the family will be better off without him/her)</li><br>

				" Sometimes these thoughts can occur when we are feeling extremely sad, hopeless and discouraged in life. ",
                                

				" Although the wish to die or end it all can be part and parcel of clinical depression, such thoughts can occur independently of depression too. More overall individuals with depression do not necessarily experience suicidal thoughts.",
                                
                                " While for some people, these thoughts are fleeting and come to one’s mind only in an extremely overwhelming situation; for some others these thoughts can be intense and nagging and may seem like the only possible solution to a problem. ",

				" The frequency and intensity of these thoughts may vary from individual to individual and may also change from one point of time to another in the same individual, depending on the immediate life context and how we perceive our resources to cope with difficulties. Just because you get these thoughts does not always mean that you will lose control and act on them. When suicidal thoughts cross our minds, typically it is not because we want to end our life but because we want a way to decrease our pain or suffering or to feel more in control. Hence when we are able to do something about this (even a little thing) /get even a small additional resource/see the whole issue slightly differently, it can minimize our suffering and bring back a sense of some control and then such thoughts can decrease significantly and disappear.
