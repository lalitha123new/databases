					"<strong>Scheduling 'worry time'</strong><br>1. Although this strategy seems paradoxical, it can be one of the useful strategies to manage excessive worrying.<br>2. You may decide to regularly schedule a worry-time towards evening (not just before bed time).<br>3. This scheduled time 'allotted' for worrying should be a brief period of about 20 to 30 minutes.<br>4. During this scheduled period, you have to write down all the worries/worrisome thoughts.<br>5. Towards the end of the worry period, you may also start putting in some self-instructions about handling the worry/worrying situation.<br>6. Visualize this strategy as worrying by the clock! It is to do with learning to start and stop at one's will and to condition one's mind to restricted worrying to a given time and place.<br>7. The overall goal is to decrease the sense of loss of control over worry that excessive worriers experience.<br>8. Throughout the day, if you  notice yourself to have started  to worry, you  can write a phrase/a sentence  about the worry on a slip of paper and keep it aside to think about it during your 'worry time'.<br>9. This acts as a 'Stop signal' when one starts worrying outside the 'worry-time'.<br>10. Worry-time is thus essentially a predetermined restricted period and time of the day, dedicated only for worrying in order to contain spilling over of worrying all through the day.<br>11. Moreover writing down one's worries may also serve the purpose of clarifying one's thoughts better than when we run them over and over again in our heads. It gives us a chance to examine our worries in a more objective/realistic fashion. Practice of this exercise can help some individuals regain some sense of control over excessive worrying.<br><br>",
					"<strong>Talk back to worrying thoughts</strong><br>Becoming aware what we are telling ourselves when worrying and then changing what we tell ourselves is a self-talk technique that can be learnt with practice.<br>Imagine that a person who is worrying has three different mind-states.<br>When the emotional mind-state is dominant, the worries can get bigger and bigger, and one becomes more and more anxious and stressed.<br>When the rational mind-state is dominant: One tries to see things logically but one may end up ignoring/denying the feelings.<br>There is a third mind state: the wise mind - which looks at the situation as a whole, utilizing both logic and emotions. It is useful to practice wise-mind self-talk.<br>"
